## Writing
I enjoy writing about front end technology and how to transition to the field as a career changer. Check back here for more or follow me on <a href="https://medium.com/@adriennemcd" target="_blank">Medium.</a>

## Speaking
Once or twice a year, I speak on panels about being a woman in tech and/or a career changer. It's a great reminder of the challenges that present themselves at the beginning, and I aim to give actionable advice on how to get that first job as a developer.
