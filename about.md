<div class="basicPage">
Hello!  I'm Adrienne McDonnell and I am a freelance front-end web developer currently seeking opportunities in Philadelphia.
<br /><br />
I am a self-motivated and inquisitive individual and approach challenges with creativity and rigorous attention to detail. I have a keen eye for design and a love for logical problem-solving. I look forward to contributing to a hardworking team that encourages thoughtful collaboration and continual learning. 
<br /><br />
I have an academic background in geospatial analysis, but have been exploring web design and web development since the days of scrolling banners and fancy rainbow text (Neopets shop theming anyone?).  My current transition to programming began as a desire to make GIS analysis more accessible and interactive via web mapping, and my enthusiasm for web development has grown ever since.
<br /><br />
This site was designed and built mobile-first using Jekyll, Sass, and jQuery.
