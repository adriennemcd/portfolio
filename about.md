Hello!  I'm Adrienne McDonnell.  I have a background in geospatial analysis and am currently seeking opportunities in front end web development.  My transition to programming began as a desire to make GIS analysis more accessible and interactive via web mapping, and my enthusiasm for web development has grown ever since.
