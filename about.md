## Intro
I'm Adrienne McDonnell and I'm a front end web developer based in Philadelphia. I'm a creative thinker, enthusiastic autodidact, and motivated problem-solver. In my role as front end developer, I value accessible-first development, thoughtful collaboration, and rigorous attention to detail. 

## Background
I have an academic background in geography and geospatial analysis, but have been exploring web design and web development since the days of scrolling banners and fancy rainbow text (Neopets shop theming anyone?). My transition to web development began as a desire to make GIS analysis more accessible and interactive via web mapping, and my enthusiasm for the field has grown ever since.

## Skills
I have a solid foundation of front end skills for building websites in various content management systems (Sitecore, WordPress, and Drupal) with HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, and jQuery, as well as single page applications with React.  For data visualizations and mapping, I use D3.js, Leaflet.js, and Google Maps API.  I have experience with Node.js, Grunt, Gulp, and NPM scripts to create a structured and clear front-end build system. My goal is always to write responsive, accessible, maintainable, cross-browser code.
  
## Volunteering & Hobbies
I am passionate about making the tech field a more inclusive community. To this end, I volunteer with Girl Develop It and offer support to others making the transition to tech through writing, speaking, and one-on-one mentoring. Please reach out if you want to talk.

When I'm not coding, I pursue other creative outlets like weaving, jewelry making, and painting.  If only there were more hours in a day!
