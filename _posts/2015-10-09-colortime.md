This is an app for color story exploration.  We all get stuck in a color story rut every once in awhile. Perhaps you're a fan of analogous colors, or can't get away from that lovely yellow/purples complimentary pair.

Colortime to the rescue! Every time you visit, colortime suggests new colors - allowing you to develop unexpected and engaging color stories.
